* Write a more narrow replacement for whitequark/ast.

  Our node class could reduce the public interface of nodes a lot.

* Add the ability to stop tracking evaluators in case of error.

  Currntly only non tracking evaluators allow this via the TransformError exception.

* Add the ability to return ASTs from evaluators. 

  AST based optimization *could* be more easy.
